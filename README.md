# LINE Ch-EN Bot
A LINE chat bot uses Google Translate API to convert Chinese to English

This project is try to solve problem that there is no official LINE Bot can translate Chinese to English and vice versa. So I connect LINE Messaging API v2 and Google Translate API for my own group chat.

This project is for developer wants to deploy on heroku, and only translate Chinese to English, no language detection. It's very welcome to fork for other platform and with language detection. Just let me know if you done that!

If you are interested in how I did this, you can go to [here](https://medium.com/@md.tsai/%E9%A1%8C%E5%A4%96%E8%A9%B1%E4%B9%8B-line-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%BF%BB%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87-bot-a76ccb3172c8) to see why and how I did this (in Chinese, sorry for no English version).
